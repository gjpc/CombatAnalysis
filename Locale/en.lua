The complete parsing function. Since the order of text in the combat log is likely to differ in
different languages, this entire function is included  in the localization class.

The function is given an input line from the combat log, and parses that line to determine its meaning.
The final step in each section is to return the extracted values. These lines need not be updated, but
the correct info must be extracted into the relevant fields.

Note the use of numeric values for avoids, critical hits, dmg types, and morale/power. These numbers
correspond to the orderings in the four lists directly above this comment block.

You will need to know something about lua pattern matching and/or regex's to attempt to translate this
section. See http://www.lua.org/pil/20.2.html for more details.
